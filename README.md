Displayed here are two websites I created for the Tech Academy utilzing HTML and CSS.

The first is an example home page for a Racing Company that was stylized using CSS and contains a functioanl navbar, image containers, and a contact form for submissions. https://github.com/cwatson16/HTML-CSS-Projects/blob/main/Website%20Project/index2.html

The second is an example home page for a movie theater company that is stylized using Bootstrap 4. It contains many of the common Bootstrap components, such as a a navbar, jumbotron, form cards, and dropdowns. https://github.com/cwatson16/HTML-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Bootstrap4_project
